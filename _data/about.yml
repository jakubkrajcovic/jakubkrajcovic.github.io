- header: Transformational leader in technology, problem solver and merchant of knowledge
  subheader: "I so"
  description: "<p>I am a technology leader, a problem solver and a global citizen. I explore global citizenship, modern-day anti-fragility strategies for life, technology innovation, wealth building and innovative business ideas. I strongly believe that one of the most important qualities to achieving an interesting life is to have a subversive attitude towards the status quo. Challenging the establishment in unexpected and subtle ways generally provides the best course forward. (but never the most straightforward one)</p>

<p>I transform businesses and ideas and take them from good to great. I deeply believe in culture and developing the people around me, learning and sharing and transparent leadership. I've lived and worked on 2 continents and in multiple countries. I have a background in cloud computing, high performance computing and possess a very broad set of skills spanning business, technology, entrepreneurship, marketing, customer service and more. I am bilingual, multi-cultural and world-travelled. </p>

<p>My non-technology interests involve investing (especially innovative investments in agriculture and passive income investments), business models, brewing and craft beer, diving and travelling and a general appreciation for life.</p>"
